# Addit-fixes
Fixing a school-project called "Addit".
To pass the test I need to fix/rewrite some code, at least 50 lines.

## Need to..
Need to show I either get nodeJS + JS or AngularJS + JS.
Shouldn't be that hard. ;)

So to begin with, I need to read the code and see which parts can be improved.

## Parts to improve:


## Fixes:
Fixed a missing semicolon in public/js/app.js on line 7.
